This project has been made while taking the JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann **The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!**. This is actually a recreation of the second project of the course. **Nonetheless**, instead of adding here his UI, I decided I wanted to challenge myself. So I created this simple UI from scratch and coded the JavaScript all by myself <s>(and a bit of help from StackOverflow...)</s>.
